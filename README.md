# modern-gradle-template

I learn Gradle because I want a simplified syntax to describe a multi-module project, so I payed and learned from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-gradle-fundamentals/)

But I end up with this crazy setup that is 10x more complicated than my [current maven multi-module project setup](https://github.com/CXwudi/vocadb-video-downloader-new) ðŸ˜‚

Definitely overkilled for small, personal, or school projects...

## How crazy ðŸ˜² is this template

See how I structured my precompiled script plugins
