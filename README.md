# modern-gradle-template

I learn Gradle because I want a simplified syntax to describe a multi-module project, so I payed and learned
from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-gradle-fundamentals/)

But I end up with this crazy setup that is 10x more complicated than
my [current maven multi-module project setup](https://github.com/CXwudi/vocadb-video-downloader-new) ðŸ˜‚

Definitely overkilled for small, personal, or school projects...

## How crazy ðŸ˜² is this template

See how I structured my precompiled script plugins

Also, each module is an independent submodule in the `gradle/plugins` build source project,
and each module in the same layer will never depend on each other.

This is explicitly designed to boost build performance from gradle parallel execution.

## I want to use this template

Thanks for considering my template ðŸ™‚, just do the following things, and you are good to go:

1. Delete these sample submodules begin with `sample-`.
2. Modify the project name in `rootProject.name` in [`settings.gradle.kts`](settings.gradle.kts) to your own project name.
3. Globally change the group name `poc.cx.glp` to your own group name.
   The group name `poc.cx.glp` is defined in [`dev-version-constraints`](gradle/platform/dev-version-constraints/build.gradle.kts)
   module
   and is referred in the [root plugin](gradle/plugins/root) and the [lib mixin plugin](gradle/plugins/mixin/lib) directories.
4. Delete everything in [mixin plugins folder](gradle/plugins/mixin) and [convention plugins folder](gradle/plugins/convention),
   and delete everything in the [version catalog](gradle/libs.versions.toml),
   and delete everything in the `constraints` block in
   the [`dev-version-constraints` platform](gradle/platform/dev-version-constraints/build.gradle.kts)
   - Tips: you can choose to not delete some stuff if you find them useful
5. Add your own mixin plugins and convention plugins, as well as your own libraries used in the project into the version catalog
